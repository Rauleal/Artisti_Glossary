# Aesthetic Object

An aesthetic object is a physical or abstract object that is appreciated for its beauty or emotional impact, rather than for its utility or practical value. 

Traditionaly, aesthetic objects are socisted with fine arts. For example a painting, a sculpture, music literature. 
Following Kant this can be seen further to more siblime objects as a natural landscape, or a sublime expirence itself.

In my practice a the aesthetic object I am particullary interestid id code, or source code, how can can seen as an easthetic object itself.
