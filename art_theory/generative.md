## Generative methodology

With more traditional art forms—sculpture, painting, or film, for example—an artist uses tools to
fashion materials into a finished work. This is clearly doing it the hard way. With generative art,
the autonomous system does all the heavy lifting; the artist only provides the instructions to the
system and the initial conditions.

The artist’s role in the production process may be closer to that of a curator than a creator. You
create a system, model it, nurture it, and refine it, but ultimately your ownership of the work
produced may be no more than a parent’s pride in the work of their offspring.

This is hideously unfair, of course. We shouldn’t underestimate the human role in the collaboration.
In addition to the programming, the human contributes one other important skill: aesthetic
judgment. It’s feasible for computers to develop a sense of aesthetics (plenty of work toward this
aim has been done within the field of evolutionary systems2), but it will never be the best division
of labor in a human-machine creative partnership. If we need to calculate pi to a million digits, it
would be a misappropriation of resources to set a human brain to this task. Similarly, it’s probably
best not to leave it to machines to decide what’s pretty and what isn’t.

Although GenArt is almost always abstract in nature, it can’t be defined by the style of the work.
The common factor of generative artworks is the methodology of its production, not the style
of the end result.

Excerpt From:: "Generative Art - Matt Pearson - p 4"

“Generative design fundamentally changes the design process: the designer shifts from being a performer of tasks to being a conductor, effectively orchestrating the decision-making process of the computer. This is what generative design is all about: iteratively developing different processes and then selecting those that produce the most visually compelling results. Designers and artists no longer have to use the tools dictated by computers and powerful but prescriptive design software and can now create their own tools, which generate amazing results independently, as many of the examples in the book demonstrate.”

Excerpt From: "Generative Design - Benedikt Gross p 4"

To be able to call a methodology generative, our first hard-and-fast rule needs to be that autonomy
must be involved. The artist creates ground rules and formulae, usually including random or semirandom
elements, and then kicks off an autonomous process to create the artwork. The system
can’t be entirely under the control of the artist, or the only generative element is the artist herself.
The second hard-and-fast rule therefore is there must be a degree of unpredictability. It must be
possible for the artist to be as surprised by the outcome as anyone else.

Creating a generative artwork is always a collaboration, even if the artist works alone. Partauthorship
of any generative work must belong in part to the mechanisms the artist uses: the
system that generates it. Fortunately, anonymous autonomous systems aren’t usually bothered
if their unscrupulous artistic partners decide to steal all the credit.

## Generative ART

Philip Galanter, artist and professor at Texas A&M University, from his 2003 paper “What Is Generative Art? Complexity Theory as a Context for Art Theory”:1 “Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.”


Generative art is neither programming nor art, in their conventional sense. It’s both and neither
of these things. Programming is an interface between man and machine; it’s a clean, logical
discipline, with clearly defined aims. Art is an emotional subject, highly subjective and defying
definition. Generative art is the meeting place between the two; it’s the discipline of taking
strict, cold, logical processes and subverting them into creating illogical, unpredictable, and
expressive results.

Generative art isn’t something we build, with plans, materials, and tools. It’s grown, much like a
flower or a tree is grown; but its seeds are logic and electronics rather than soil and water. It’s an
emergent property of the simplest of processes: logical decisions and mathematics. Generative
art is about creating the organic using the mechanical.
