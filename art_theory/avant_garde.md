# Avant Garde

The Avant Garde movement was an artistic movement of the XIX century that promoted art as politics. Art ought to be part of everyday live and serve as a mean of change.

## Digital Avant Garde

I aim for a Digital Avant Garde movement where art and technology serve as a mean of change. The main challenge here is the lack of technology knowledge and skill
on artisits enviroments (e.g. GRA). The consequence of this is technology is used as a tool instead of a companion for creation. 
This is also rooted in an antropocene perspective where humans are to dictate how technology should behave or used.

I believe a transhuman aproach where humans are skillfull to collaborate for technology, will improve the understanding for a real Digital Avant Garde.
