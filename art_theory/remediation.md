# Remediation

In the context of media studies, remediation refers to the process by which *new media* incorporates or transform elements of older or traditional media forms. It involves the adaptation, reinterpretation, or repurposing of existing media content and formats in a new technological context.

Remediation reflects the ongoing evolution and adaptation of media in response to technological advancements and cultural changes. In a traditional sense, remediations highlights the relationship between old and new media. However, this old and new adjectives do not add much to the discourse. Remediation is about the influence of past media forms on shaping and informing the present and future of media.

The concept of remediation was introduced by media theorists Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin in their book "Remediation: Understanding New Media" published in 1999. According to their theory, media constantly borrow and rework elements from previous media forms, resulting in a cycle of remediation.

Remediation can take different forms, such as: 

* __Immediacy:__ The attempt to make new media technologies simulate the experience of direct and unmediated interaction with reality, often by incorporating features of older media forms. For example, a virtual reality (VR) experience that aims to create a sense of immersion and presence in a simulated environment.

* __Hypermediacy:__ The emphasis on the multiple layers, interfaces, and visual elements of a medium to make users aware of the medium itself. This can be seen in websites or video games that incorporate graphical interfaces, pop-ups, and overlapping windows to enhance the sense of engagement and interactivity.

* __Transparent Remediation:__ The seamless integration of old media forms into new media technologies. For example, a digital e-book that mimics the appearance and functionality of a traditional printed book, including page-turning animations.

* __Remixing and Mashups:__ The practice of combining and recontextualizing elements from different media sources to create new forms of content. This can be seen in music remixes, video mashups, or image collages.
