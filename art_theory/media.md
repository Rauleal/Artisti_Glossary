# Media

In a genral sense, media refers to the various *means* or channels of communications used to transmint information. 

Information here relates to the concept of content, or message, that wants to be transmited explicitly and implicitly. In this last part i refer back to mcLuhan where he stated that "the medium is the message" where he actually mean that the choice of media to trasmit a message is already the message in itself.

Media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, disseminating news, entertainment, and cultural content, and facilitating communication on a global scale. It provides a platform for information exchange, storytelling, and the expression of ideas and opinions. Media also has the potential to influence society, raise awareness, and impact public discourse.

## New Media

New media refers to forms of media that have emerged or evolved with the advent of digital technology and the internet. Some of the characteristic of new media is that it involves interactive and participatory elements, allowing users to engage, collaborate, and create content. Consider this in parallel to "old media" like the newspapers where it is more a one side flow of information.

One of the key chracteristics of new media is that consumers and creators are no longer "diferent". In "old media" there are a few creators that curate the content to be broadcasted. In new media there are several content creators which implies that the curation of content is no longer reallistically possible.

Some examples of new media include:

* __Websites and Blogs:__ Online platforms that enable individuals and organizations to publish and share information, opinions, and multimedia content.

* __Social Media:__ Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat that allow users to create profiles, connect with others, and share content in real-time.

* __Digital Streaming Services:__ Platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Spotify that provide on-demand access to video, music, and other forms of media content.

* __Mobile Apps:__ Applications designed for smartphones and tablets that offer a wide range of functionalities, including communication, entertainment, and information retrieval.

* __Podcasts:__ Audio-based content that can be streamed or downloaded, covering a wide range of topics and genres.
