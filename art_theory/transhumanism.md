# Transhumanism

Not to be confused with posthumanism. In short, transhumanism focuses on the on human enhancement. 

Transhumanism traces its roots within the Enlighten- ment and does not reject the humanistic tradition. Sometimes the symbol ‘H+’ is used as an acronym for ‘Humanity Plus’. 

The main keys in transhumansim are identified in science and technology, in their existing, emerging and speculative frames. In the progressive timeline of the transhuman, the future bears unique potentials: some humans may transcend their actual outfit in such radical ways as to become posthuman. This is another reason causing the theoretical confusion between posthumanism and transhumanism. In fact, within the transhuman literature, the term ‘posthu- man’ refers to a stage which might evolve after the current transhuman era. On the other side, according to posthumanism, the posthuman can be seen as a paradigm shift which is already occurring by approaching and performing the human in post-humanist, post-anthropocentric and post-dualistic ways.
