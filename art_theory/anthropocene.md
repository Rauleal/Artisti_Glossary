Excerpt from "Oxford languages"

Although Oxfor languages talks about the current geological age, the Anthropocene Epoch is an unofficial unit of geologic time. It is used to describe the most recent period in Earth’s history when human activity started to have a significant impact on the planet’s climate and ecosystems. In other words, humans have become such a force of nature that they are afecting the planet itself. Given the order of magnitud of geological changes, there is controversy on whether the current peiriod will ever really qualify as a geological age.

The word Anthropocene is derived from the Greek words anthropo, for “man,” and cene for “new,” coined and made popular by biologist Eugene Stormer and chemist Paul Crutzen in 2000. So Anthropocene can be translated as "Man-new". Which can also understood as the age, or epoch, of humans. This in the scence that most resources, consumptions and developemnts are focused for the benefit of the human race. Disregarding other elements of the ecosystem.

Excerpt from 'Me"

Officially, the current epoch is called the Holocene, which began 11,700 years ago after the last major ice age. Various start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, ranging from the beginning of the Agricultural Revolution 12,000–15,000 years ago, to as recently as the 1960s. The ratification process is still ongoing, and thus a date remains to be decided definitively, but the peak in radionuclides fallout consequential to atomic bomb testing during the 1950s has been more favoured than others, locating a possible beginning of the Anthropocene to the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945, or the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963.
